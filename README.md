# WoodenTangramPuzzle
The puzzle game - my first Android project. This game was created on the basis of an old Soviet puzzle game. 
Over time, when there was a desire to study programming for Android, the idea arose to translate this game into an electronic form 
and thereby to combine business with pleasure. During the development process, at the same time, it was found the original name of this kind of puzzles is tangram.
This is an ancient Chinese puzzle consisting of seven flat polygons, called tans, which are put together to form shapes. 
The objective is to replicate a pattern (given only an outline) generally found in a puzzle book using all seven pieces without overlap.
